            The ways it can be prepared are countless, and it blends perfectly with other foods, making it a pillar of the world's nourishment.
            For this specific occasion and for effects of laziness, we'll cover your standard issue cooked rice.

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 long onion stalk, 6 or 7 cm approx.</li>
                    <li>1 tsp salt</li> 
                    <li>1 tbsp oil</li>
                    <li>4 cups of water</li>
                    <li>2 cups of rice</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Put the water to boil in a pot.</li>
                    <li>Add the salt and the oil to the water.</li>
                    <li>While it boils, wash the rice in a strainer. (This one is optional, don't do it if you don't deem it necessary!)</li>
                    <li>Once the water boils, pour the rice in the pot and mix it.</li>
                    <li>Let it boil until the water level is the same as the rice. It should've made small-sized holes of steam in the rice at this point. </li>
                    <li>Put the lid on the pot, and lower the heat to a point where the water won't completely evaporate, as the rice will burn if this happens. :c</li>
                    <li>After 10 minutes, sprinkle the rice evenly with 1/4 cup of water.</li>
                    <li>Repeat the previous step, and leave the rice for another 15 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Serve with other foods of your liking, and enjoy.</li>
                </ol>
