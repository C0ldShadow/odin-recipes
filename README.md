This is the first project carried out as part of the curriculum in the Odin Project.
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the abilities learned during the HTML section. Within it, it'll be displayed capabilities such as adding images to the website, separate paragraphs correctly and distinguish different areas with the use of headings.
