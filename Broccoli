                    Broccoli is a vegetable with abundant 'heads' that give it a tree-like appearance.
                    It bears a close resemblance to the cauliflower, being a green variation. It's usually steamed or boiled, but it can also be consumed raw.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It has high amounts of vitamin C, vitamin E and healthy fiber.

                    Also, some children hate them, for some reason.
